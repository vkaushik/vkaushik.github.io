        Hi,
        <p>I am excited to express my interest in the available opportunity at your esteemed company. With over 11 years of professional IT experience, I have consistently delivered enterprise-grade microservices, data pipelines, and APIs in distributed, multi-cloud environments with high scalability, reliability, and availability requirements. I have set up projects from scratch, including architecture, monitoring, tests, and CI/CD, and am skilled in Golang, Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, SRE, System Design, and Data Structures.</p>
        <p>In my current role at EPAM as a Lead Software Engineer, I have been recognized with the prestigious <b>Impact Award</b> for extraordinary contributions to technology and business. I am also an advocate for leveraging modern AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and have built and used MCP agents to accelerate development, improve code quality, and drive innovation within my teams.</p>
        <p>Previously, at Walmart, I architected and implemented solutions that empowered product teams to monitor and set up alerts for their services, significantly improving MTTD and MTTR in production. At ThoughtWorks, I led projects from inception to delivery, championing agile practices and fostering a culture of inclusivity, creativity, and collaboration.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about adopting new technologies, building high-performing teams, and creating a positive impact. I look forward to learning more about this opportunity and how I can contribute to your organizationâ€™s success.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Sincerely,<br />
            Vikas Kaushik</p>

<!-- <p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the available job opportunity at your company. In over 10 years
    of professional IT experience, I have successfully delivered enterprise-grade applications, microservices,
    and libraries, including tests, instrumentation, and monitoring in production. My expertise lies in ensuring
    scalability, reliability, and availability in all projects I undertake.</p>

<p>I am hands-on in Golang, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD setup, deployments, Kafka, Prometheus, and Grafana, and
    well-versed in data structures and system design. At Walmart, I am responsible for designing and
    implementing SRE solutions, including autoscaling and anomaly detection systems, K8s operators, showback
    services, onboarding APIs, and Prometheus exporters. During my tenure at ThoughtWorks, I developed
    cloud-based enterprise web applications and data pipelines using a wide range of technologies, including
    Golang, C#, React-JS, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, OAuth, CI/CD, REST APIs, and microservices.
</p>

<p>I thrive in an environment that values inclusivity, diversity, creativity, sustainability, and collaboration.
    As an empathetic intellectual and first principle thinker, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality work
    and making a valuable contribution to the team's goals and milestones.</p>

<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the role further and how I can contribute to
    your organization's success</p> -->
